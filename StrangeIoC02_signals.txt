<SIGNAL>
==============================
How does signal works?
==============================
:::PIPELINE:::
-commandBinder.Bind<SignalName>().To<CommandName>();    //1-A,First thing first
-commandBinder.Bind<SignalName>();      //1-B, Optional,you can bind without command but still be able to add listeners
-Signal.dispatach(value);         //Fire in anywhere/command, to pass 'value' to listener/function 
-Signal.addListener(functionName);    //This is a command show you how to addlistener to the signal

:::QUESTIONS:::
- When signal should fire a command?  // It should be fired whenever it is needed to send information to another class/object
- When signal should add a listenrer?  //If you want to a object to recieve the signal and do something, inject the signal or instantiate one, then add a listener to do what you want.
- Why bind signal to be singleton? // Singleton allows it to be injection anywhere? I can't answer this question really well. 
- Sometimes a sinal is bind to a command, sometime is bind to injection, why?(So a command can fire(dispatch) it and a mediator can receive it(addListener))

:::(C)Command VS (L)listeners::::
- Both(C)(L)are allowed to pass multiple parameters
- (C) allows injection of view and signal, (L) don't 
- (C) write more codes thant (L)
- (C) binds to signal (L) not bind to signal
- (C) is to fire an signal (L) listerner is how to receive the signal and do something

:::QUESTION::::
-How to inject Interface as a Class? Why use it?


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   HERE IS AN EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
// Define ->
public class IwantFoodSingal :Signal<string, int>{}

// Bind ->
commandbinder.Bind<IwantFoodSignal>().To<IwantFoodCommand>(){}

// Inject ->
[Inject]public IwantFoodSignal signal{get;set;}

// Target ->
[Inject]public Person Jimmy{get;set;}

// Fire ->
signal.dispatch("apple", "2");

// Receive ->
signal.addListener(getNumberOfFood());

// Call ->
getNumberOfFood(string foodName, int quantity){Jimmy.foodName = foodName; Jimmy.Quantit=quantity}
